            <hr />
            <p>I've studied <span>Computer Sciences</span> at the <span>University of Szeged</span>.</p>
            <p>I was born in a small town in the Vojvodina region of Serbia which is called <span>Novi Beƒçej</span>.</p>
            <p>My mother tongue is <span>Hungarian</span>, but I can speak, read and write fluently <span>English</span> and <span>Serbian</span> also.</p>
            <p>Recently I worked as a <span>Quality Assurance Engineer</span> for a Medical Device Manufacturer company from the USA, but based in Szeged.</p>
            <p>I consider myself a <span>team player</span> because I'm really <span>communicative</span> and I'm <span>ready to learn</span> new skills thorugh work and experience.</p>
            <p>In my free time I do <span>Photography</span> and I play the <span>Piano</span> since I was little. I even have a Degree from Elementary Music School.</p>
